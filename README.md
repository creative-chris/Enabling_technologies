# The project
My Enabling technologies project, Semester 7

# The assignment
The challenge is to come up with a media solution to better illustrate what the knowledge theme
Enabling Technologies is all about and how our applied research contributes to the 'for society'
Strategy. It is important to show, not just tell. For example, use the key technology AI to make
the story an experience.

# The concept
The Enabling Technologies hub (later renamed to the innovation hub) is an interactive online
platform designed to engage users in exploring cutting-edge technologies and their real-world
applications. Through a series of immersive demos and interactive experiences, visitors can
gain hands-on experience with AI, robotics, IoT, materials innovation, energy storage, photonics,
and life science diagnostics. Each section of the hub is dedicated to a specific technology,
offering a blend of entertainment and education.

# Build
This POC is a 1 page site build by multiple components made by php, included and
linked with each other in order to work seamlessly.

The POC is responsive and has working functions sutch as: PWA & sending mail with document attachment
